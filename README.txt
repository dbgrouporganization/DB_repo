For database initialization, run the main method in the DB_Init java class. Make sure the csv
file is in the same directory as the src file. This will generate a folder named DB in the same
directory and will contain the database file. If the database file already exists and you are
trying to re-initialize it, you must first delete the outdated database before running DB_Init 
again.

To use our state-of-the-art Database Application UI, run the main method in the StartUp java
class. Our command-line-operated UI should appear in front of you.

Once in the UI, you can sign up or log in. After logging in, you will be given options on what
you can look up. Different user types are allowed different permissions. See below for access to
higher user authentication. 

If you are apart of the Quality Assurance team (or our professor), you can find various test
account usernames and passwords with varying levels of application accessibility around line 80
in DB_Init.
